# Aim:
The boom of technology in the 21st century combined with the ongoing global pandemic has made online solutions to daily problems a cheap and viable option. 
Providing a communication system for the students of an institution has become very essential.
An easy to use chatting application with one to one and group chatting features along with sharing of files is the need of the hour.

# Tech-Stack:

1. Frontend: Java, XML, Dart
2. Backend: Parse Server(Mongo DB and PostgreSQL)

# How the app works:

1. First there is a sign up/ login screen which accepts registration of students having the same institution mail
2. If the user is already logged in, the above screen does not appear and they are directed to the home page
3. In the home screen a dashboard is displayed
4. The dashboard consists of Chats, Groups, Images, Documents, My Profile and Logout features
5. In chats and groups, there is a list of all the one to one chats and the group chats rendered respectively of the user
6. To share documents or images, the personal chat as well as the group chat option pops up
7. In My Profile, the user can change their avatar
